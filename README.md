About me:
        I am originally from Glenwood Springs, Colorado, a town with more
        bears than people (I actually made that up, don't Google it). In
        my free time, I like to drink coffee and listen to music.

        In class, I enjoy making bad jokes. FYI: they don't get any better
        as the semester goes on.

        I am not serious about many things, but I am VERY serious about
        making this class a good experience for you. Please reach out if
        you need anything at any time. Let's have a great semester!
```

Once you are happy with the output, commit your changes to finish the lab. NOTE: you are only required to provide your USF username; the rest is optional.
